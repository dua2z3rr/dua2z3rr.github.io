#### Welcome!
I am **dua2z3rr**, and this site was created as a personal archive of my progress in the world of cybersecurity.

## The Journey
For about 9 months I have been dedicated to self-studying cybersecurity, focusing mainly on the Hack The Box platform. Every completed box represents not only a challenge overcome, but also a new methodology learned and documented.

## Site Objective
This space was created with a dual purpose:
- **Sharing knowledge**: Making methodologies and techniques that I have already experienced accessible, facilitating the learning path of those approaching this discipline
- **Documenting progress**: Creating a structured and easily consultable reference of the techniques and approaches used during machine resolution

The walkthroughs follow a methodical and procedural approach, always starting from initial enumeration up to privilege escalation, documenting each phase with real commands and output.

## Current Skills
At the moment I focus on the fundamentals of penetration testing, with particular attention to:
- Web Application Security
- Privilege Escalation (Linux/Windows)
- Exploitation of known vulnerabilities
- Digital Forensics (via HTB Sherlocks)

In parallel, I am developing a growing interest in **malware development**, an area I intend to explore in the coming months.

## Goals
I am currently studying to obtain the **CPTS (Certified Penetration Testing Specialist)** certification from Hack The Box, with the goal of completing most of the machines available on the platform.

## Contacts
